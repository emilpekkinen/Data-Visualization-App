# Data Visualization Application


## Current properties

The program can open .csv files, and store data obtained from the wanted file. 

## Instructions

Launching the Program: Start the program by running the main.py file. 

#### Initial Screen:
- Upon launch, the user sees an 'Open file' button.
- Clicking this opens a window to the user's files where a .csv file containing numerical data must be selected.
#### Main Menu View:
- After file selection, a main menu appears showing the data in a table format.
- Displays the name and path of the opened file.
- Buttons for creating various charts are located at the bottom of the view.
#### Chart Creation:
- 'Create Line Plot' button opens a line chart view.
- 'Create a Histogram' button opens a histogram view.
- 'Create Pie Chart' button opens a pie chart view.
#### Line Chart View:
- Displays a coordinate system with a line plot of the data.
- 'Add new file' button allows adding data from a new file to the chart.
- Options to show/hide the grid and change grid size using a slider.
- Axes and title can be renamed using the 'Rename [object]' button.
- Close the view using the red 'close window' button in the top right corner.
#### Histogram View:
- Similar functions to the line chart view but uses bars instead of lines.
- Grid, axes, and title are customizable.
- Does not support adding new files; based solely on the original .csv file.
#### Pie Chart View:
- Displays data relationships in a pie chart format.
- Only the chart's title can be changed; no axes or grid.
